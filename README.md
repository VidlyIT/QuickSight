# Quick Sight
When someone calls an ambulance there is no way of tracking where the ambulance is in relation to
the requested address. This solution would enable a person to request an ambulance wherever they
are, even if in a remote area, similar to how a passenger would request an Uber. This would also both
the person calling for medical assistance as well as the medical facility to track, geo-fence and monitor
the activities of the ambulance remotely.
